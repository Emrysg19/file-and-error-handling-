# file-and-error-handling-
PLP python week 4 assignment
How It Works
input() → Asks for the filename.

try/except → Handles FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, and other exceptions.

.upper() → Turns all file text to uppercase (you can replace this with any modification logic).

Writes → Saves the modified content to a new file with modified_ prefix.
